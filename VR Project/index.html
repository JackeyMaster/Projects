        <h3> About </h3>
        The world you are about to enter is my very own interpretation/recreation of a city in the game "Genshin Impact" called Mondstadt"
        <hr>
        <h3> What can you do in this world?</h3>
        In this world, there really no action so if you were expecting one then prepare to get dissapointed ): Back to the point, this world is mostly used for viewing the city I build based on "Mondstadt. It isnt perfect so don't get your expectation too high because you will just get dissapointed." 
        <hr>
        <h3> Interactables </h3>
        Yes, you will be able to interact in this world. Here are some interactions:
        In the blacksmith, you can talk to "Wagner" the blacksmith guy
        You can also take the coal from the table but it will stick to your hand and you will never be able to take it off again ha! (: )
