                <span class="shop-item-title"><h4>65-inch LG G1 Gallery Series 4K OLED (2021)</h4></span>
                <p>For a few years now, TV reviewers have observed that despite OLED's incredible black levels,
                  contrast,
                  and color, OLED TVs haven't been able to match QLED TVs in terms of brightness. The LG G1 Gallery
                  Series
                  goes further than any other OLED TV to address this gap, through the use of an OLED panel that LG has
                  labeled "OLED Evo."

                  It's essentially a tweak of the materials used to produce OLED panels, but it yields visible results.
                  How good is it? "The LG G1 Gallery Series produces the cleanest, most enticing imagery I’ve seen from
                  a
                  TV yet," our reviewer enthused.

                  That performance is also helped considerably by LG's latest picture processing tech, quarterbacked by
                  its fourth-generation Alpha 9 AI Processor 4K along with its AI Picture Pro algorithms. While it can
                  sometimes be a little overzealous with motion smoothing unless you intercede, its ability to upscale
                  compressed, non-4K content is the best we've ever seen.

                  The G1 is ideal for those who want to wall-mount their TV — it comes with everything you need. But
                  it's
                  one of the few TVs that doesn't come with a stand. If you need one, there are two options: A set of
                  feet
                  and a fancier, tripod-based unit, but both are paid extras.

                  With four HDMI 2.1 inputs, the G1 is more than a pretty face— it's a gamer's dream. With Nvidia
                  G-Sync,
                  AMD FreeSync, HGiG profile support, variable refresh rate (VRR), Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM), and 4K
                  120Hz in HDR at full RGB color, this is one of the only TVs in the world that can provide gamers with
                  a
                  big-screen experience that can compare to a dedicated gaming monitor.

                  LG has also — finally! — updated its good but aging WebOS interface. It's now thoroughly modern with a
                  clean, task-driven interface and there's even a dedicated gaming control center for quick access to
                  all
                  of the settings that gamers need. LG's magic remote has been given a beneficial makeover too, and a
                  clever new "MagicTap" feature that uses NFC to quickly pair your phone to your TV.

                  If you're wondering about a cheaper option, there is one — LG's C1 Series OLED TV is superb in every
                  way
                  and is the best OLED TV value for the money. But it can't quite keep up with the G1 in terms of
                  overall
                  picture quality, so the G1 remains our top pick.

                <p>When LG rolled out its new OLED Evo panels on a handful of 2021 models, we were beyond impressed with
                  what the new hardware meant for TV-watching, especially certain types of movies. With promises of
                  OLED-flavored contrast linking hands with the type of brightness only seen on the most powerful QLED
                  sets, the Evo engineering delivered an all-immersive, at-home cinema experience that looks fantastic
                  in
                  even the most brightly-lit rooms.

                  Fast-forward to present day where LG is rolling out a number of its 2022 models, one of which being
                  the
                  much-loved LG C2 OLED Evo. While not considered a flagship set, the C2 builds upon a number of the
                  amazing picture features and other add-ons that we loved about its predecessor, the LG C1.

                  Available in sizes from 55 inches up to 83 inches, the 65-inch C2 is that perfect middle-ground size
                  for
                  most homes. And in terms of design and tech, LG really notched things up this year. The C2 features a
                  totally reworked WRGB screen with chart-topping peak brightness marks, four HDMI 2.1 inputs for all
                  our
                  next-gen entertainment sources, and an improved Alpha 9 Gen 5 processor that delivers breathtaking
                  colors, adaptive brightness control, and incredible upscaling.

                  Gamers will appreciate the inclusion of Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync, with both technologies banding
                  together to create the ideal TV for high-bandwidth, action-oriented gameplay from today's leading
                  consoles and PCs.</p>

                <p>As with any great TV, it isn't just one feature that makes the Hisense U7G such a great choice, and
                  as
                  our TV reviewer Caleb Denison pleasantly discovered in his full review, it's the full package at an
                  amazing price, which is why this set has also landed at the top of our best TVs under $1,000 list,
                  too.

                  But let's start with the U7G's biggest asset: Its brightness. Hisense has a history of making TVs that
                  are brighter than the competition (see the U8G below), and the U7G is a case in point. With up to
                  1,000
                  nits of peak brightness, you'll be able to enjoy both standard dynamic range (SDR) and high dynamic
                  range (HDR) content in virtually any lighting conditions your room might have.

                  Brightness without control just leads to washed-out colors and blacks that look more like grays, which
                  is why we like the U7G so much — it uses 90 local dimming zones to keep the dark areas of an image
                  looking nice and inky, so that field of stars from your favorite sci-fi title looks like it's
                  genuinely
                  in space.

                  It's easy to take advantage of the U7G's picture quality. It packs every major flavor of HDR including
                  HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and HLG, giving you tons of compatibility with whatever your favorite
                  streaming service provides. Thanks to its 120Hz native panel refresh rate, this smart TV is also a
                  great
                  gaming TV. With two HDMI 2.1 ports (and another two HDMI 2.0 ports), you can connect your choice of
                  gaming console or PC and get 4K resolution at 120Hz, along with variable refresh rate (VRR), auto
                  low-latency mode (ALLM), and support for AMD's FreeSync VRR technology.

                  When it comes to audio, Dolby Atmos support is available, and you can send that signal to your
                  soundbar
                  or A/V receiver in full, 24-bit lossless quality with the U7G's HDMI eARC connection.

                  Like the U8G, the U7G uses Google's Android TV operating system, which means you get Chromecast
                  built-in
                  as well as access to Google Assistant. But Hisense has taken this a step further: You can grab the
                  included, backlit remote and press a button to speak your commands, or you can do it hands-free using
                  the TV's built-in far-field microphones.

                  So is there a downside? Just one: As awesome as the U7G's picture quality is, that quality can be
                  affected by your viewing position. It's best to sit directly in front of this TV, as its off-angle
                  viewing is not as good as some of the other TVs on this list.</p>
