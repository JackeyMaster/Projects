                  <h4>Apple iPhone 13</h4>
                </span>
                <p>It has a new processor, a bigger battery, 128GB of internal storage, and uses the same large camera
                  sensor as the acclaimed iPhone 12 Pro Max, but you wouldn’t know it from its compact size.In fact, the
                  13 looks almost identical to the 12 but is just a bit thicker and heavier, with substantially bigger
                  camera bumps and lenses that swapped places. (No, you won’t be able to reuse your iPhone 12 case for
                  the
                  13.) Otherwise, it has the same overall design, a brighter 6.1-inch OLED display, the same
                  12-megapixel
                  selfie camera, the same MagSafe wireless charging, the same water and dust resistance (IP68), and the
                  same support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks. On top of all that, it comes in six colors
                  (including pink), one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.

                  What’s different with the iPhone 13’s new A15 Bionic chip is that it should still feel fast in years
                  to
                  come, but it’s difficult to measure significant speed improvements with iPhones. The new chip helps
                  the
                  iPhone 13 run more efficiently, which lasts well into the evening without needing a top up.

                  Using the same camera sensor that made the iPhone 12 Pro Max the best smartphone camera for photos and
                  videos in 2020, the iPhone 13’s main wide-angle camera has

                  FOR MOST PEOPLE, THE IPHONE 13 IS AN EASY CHOICE
                  significantly improved. Photo details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being
                  oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low
                  light and night sight are both exceptional. Its ultrawide camera, on the other hand, has only been
                  minorly updated for better low-light performance.

                  Video quality is also great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking
                  around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow-mo and handles them all super
                  well.
                  It even lets you record videos in Cinematic mode, which helps you smoothly switch focus between
                  subjects
                  by changing the depth of field.

                  The iPhone 13 starts with 128GB of storage. Because its storage is not expandable, and depending on
                  how
                  you’ll be using the phone, you might want to bite the bullet and upgrade to the next tier.

                  For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice: it offers similar performance, design, camera
                  features, and (sometimes) better battery life than other iPhone 13 models, for less money.

                  <h4>SAMSUNG GALAXY S22 PLUS</h4>
                </span>
                <p>Those of us in the US have plenty of phones to choose from in the budget end of the market, but
                  high-end Android phones are looking scarce lately. Thankfully, the options we do have are very good,
                  making this recommendation a close call with the Google Pixel 6. Still, we think that the Galaxy S22
                  Plus is the best device for most people.

                  The S22 Plus features a big, bright 6.6-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate, 2022’s Android flagship
                  chipset of choice, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, and three high-quality rear cameras. You don’t get the 10x
                  telephoto or the built-in S Pen of the Ultra, but you do get a more spacious screen compared to the
                  6.1-inch standard S22. It’s a comfortable middle ground that’s the right configuration of features and
                  size for most people. While the screen and overall performance are excellent, the S22 Plus comes up a
                  little short on battery life. The 4,500mAh cell will last lighter users a full day, but moderate and
                  heavy users who stream a decent amount of video will likely find themselves running the battery down
                  into the single digits by the end of the day. It’s a bit frustrating to have to keep an eye on your
                  battery usage on a $999 phone. If great battery life is important to you, then look at the Google
                  Pixel
                  6, which does much better in that department.

                  Samsung’s software is still our least favorite part of a Samsung phone, which is more cluttered and
                  contains more duplicate apps than we’d prefer. If you’re looking for an alternative that’s a little
                  sleeker, the OnePlus 10 Pro is a good option. Just know that it doesn’t work on AT&T’s 5G network
                  (just
                  LTE), and its cameras aren’t quite as good as Samsung’s. Otherwise, it’s a very nice device that feels
                  a
                  little more sophisticated.

                  Battery and software gripes aside, there’s a lot to like about the S22 Plus. The screen is a pleasure
                  to
                  use, the camera system is versatile and dependable, and Samsung’s policy of providing up to four
                  generations of OS upgrades is one of the best among Android phones. Its minimalist, understated design
                  has a little more mainstream appeal than the Pixel 6, which isn’t actually much bigger but looks and
                  feels bulkier. It may be one of a few truly high-end Android phones offered in the US right now, but
                  don’t let that fool you into thinking it’s a winner only by default; it also happens to be a very good
                  device.</p>

                  <h4>APPLE IPHONE 13 PRO AND IPHONE 13 PRO MAX</h4>
                </span>
                <p>Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same top-of-the-line camera system this year,
                  and they are our pick as the iPhone for photos and videos. This time around, you don’t have to buy the
                  biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system — you get the same experience with
                  either
                  of the Pro models.

                  The three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image
                  processing
                  to produce stunning images, particularly in low light. If photo and video quality is your most
                  important
                  factor when buying a phone, the 13 Pro is where you should be spending your money.

                  The 13 Pro has a physically larger camera sensor compared to prior models that allows its main
                  12-megapixel camera to gather more light and produce better-quality images, especially in dark or
                  challenging lighting conditions. Its ultrawide camera is able to take stunning macro photos, thanks to
                  its new close focus capability. In addition, the 3x optical zoom on the telephoto lens makes for great
                  portrait photography. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization make
                  for stable and beautiful videos, even in low light. You can even shoot and edit videos directly in
                  ProRes on the iPhone 13 Pro (as long as you have a 256GB or higher storage model).

                  For those looking for the best Android camera system available, we recommend getting the $899 Google
                  Pixel 6 Pro, especially if a telephoto lens is a must. We pitted the Pixel 6 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro
                  cameras in a comparison video, and the results are pretty evenly split. While the Pixel 6 Pro’s video
                  capabilities are still behind the iPhone, it can more than hold its own on stills, and its telephoto
                  camera is even better than the iPhone 13 Pro’s.</p>
