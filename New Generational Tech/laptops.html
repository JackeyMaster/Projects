                <p>The latest MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M2 processor, is the best laptop for most people.

                  The base model, which includes 8GB of memory, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU, and an 8-core GPU,
                  starts at $1,199. A model with 512GB of storage, which is what we recommend for most people and will
                  let you keep using the laptop for longer, costs $1,399.

                  The Air has lost the wedge-shape design that was its calling card for years but retains many of the
                  other excellent features of years past, including MagSafe charging, Touch ID, and the scissor-switch
                  keyboard, and adds a new 1080p webcam and two new color options.

                  The M2 processor inside isn’t as fast or powerful as the M1 Pro or M1 Max you get in the larger (and
                  more expensive) MacBook Pro models, but it’s still mighty fast. In our testing, it was able to handle
                  intense office workloads with little to no heat or slowdown. Given how thin and light this device is,
                  it delivers a combination of power and portability that you’ll be hard-pressed to find in many other
                  machines out there.</p>

                <span class="shop-item-title"><h4>HP SPECTRE X360 14</h4></span>
                <p>It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous
                  machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel.

                  But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work
                  driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance
                  with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of
                  the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen.

                  On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your
                  fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches
                  magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much
                  every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy
                  audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market.

                  Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything
                  they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows
                  convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.</p>

                <p>At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy.
                  But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile
                  chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the
                  system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution.

                  Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad
                  are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the
                  battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming
                  machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list.
